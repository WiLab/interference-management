\begin{tabular}{ l | p{10cm} }
  $e_i$ & the medium access indicator of node i; ($e_i = 1$ if node i is allowed to transmit in the considered time slot and $0$ otherwise). The random variables $e_i$ are hence \textit{i.i.d.} and independent of everything else, with $\textbf{P}](e_i = 1) = p$ ($p$ is the MAP). \\
  \hline
  $F_i^j$ & denotes the virtual power emitted by node $i$ (provided $e_i = 1$) towards receiver $y_j$ \\
  \hline
  $x:x>0$ & the set of numbers $x$ such that $x>0$ \\
  \hline
