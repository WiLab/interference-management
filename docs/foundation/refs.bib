abstract = {Spatial point processes are mathematical models used to describe and analyse the geometrical structure of patterns formed by objects that are irregularly or randomly distributed in one-, two- or three-dimensional space. Examples include locations of trees in a forest, blood particles on a glass plate, galaxies in the universe, and particle centres in samples of material. Numerous aspects of the nature of a specific spatial point pattern may be described using the appropriate statistical methods. Statistical Analysis and Modelling of Spatial Point Patterns provides a practical guide to the use of these specialised methods. The application-oriented approach helps demonstrate the benefits of this increasingly popular branch of statistics to a broad audience. The book: Provides an introduction to spatial point patterns for researchers across numerous areas of application Adopts an extremely accessible style, allowing the non-statistician complete understanding Describes the process of extracting knowledge from the data, emphasising the marked point process Demonstrates the analysis of complex datasets, using applied examples from areas including biology, forestry, and materials science Features a supplementary website containing example datasets. Statistical Analysis and Modelling of Spatial Point Patterns is ideally suited for researchers in the many areas of application, including environmental statistics, ecology, physics, materials science, geostatistics, and biology. It is also suitable for students of statistics, mathematics, computer science, biology and geoinformatics.},

@article{Nguyen2007,
abstract = {This paper presents a stochastic geometry model for the performance analysis and the planning of dense IEEE 802.11 networks. This model allows one to propose heuristic formulas for various properties of such networks like the probability for users to be covered, the probability for access points to be granted access to the channel or the average long term throughput provided to end-users. The main merit of this model is to take the effect of interferences and that of CSMA into account within this dense network context. This analytic model, which is based on Matern point processes, is partly validated against simulation. It is then used to assess various properties of such networks. We show for instance how the long term throughput obtained by end-users behaves when the access point density increases. We also briefly show how to use this model for the planning of managed networks and for the economic modeling of unplanned networks.},
